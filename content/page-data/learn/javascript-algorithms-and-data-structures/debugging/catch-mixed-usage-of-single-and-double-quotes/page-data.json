Deciding which one to use generally comes down to personal preference, with some exceptions.</p>\n<p>Having two choices is great when a string has contractions or another piece of text that's in quotes. Just be careful that you don't close the string too early, which causes a syntax error.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of mixing quotes:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const grouchoContraction = \"I've had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.\";\nconst quoteInString = \"Groucho Marx once said 'Quote me as saying I was mis-quoted.'\";\nconst uhOhGroucho = 'I've had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.';\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first two are correct, but the third is incorrect.</p>\n<p>Of course, it is okay to use only one style of quotes. You can escape the quotes inside the string by using the backslash (<code>\\</code>) escape character:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const allSameQuotes = 'I\\'ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn\\'t it.';\n</code></pre>\n</section>","id":"587d7b84367417b2b2512b37","hasEditableBoundaries":false,"instructions":"<section id=\"instructions\">\n<p>Fix the string so it either uses different quotes for the <code>href</code> value, or escape the existing ones.
