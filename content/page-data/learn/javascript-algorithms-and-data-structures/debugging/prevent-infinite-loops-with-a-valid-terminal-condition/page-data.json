Loops are great tools when you need your program to run a code block a certain number of times or until a condition is met, but they need a terminal condition that ends the looping. Infinite loops are likely to freeze or crash the browser, and cause general program execution mayhem, which no one wants.</p>\n<p>There was an example of an infinite loop in the introduction to this section - it had no terminal condition to break out of the <code>while</code> loop inside <code>loopy()</code>. Do NOT call this function!</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function loopy() {\n  while(true) {\n    console.log(\"Hello, world!\");\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It's the programmer's job to ensure that the terminal condition, which tells the program when to break out of the loop code, is eventually reached. One error is incrementing or decrementing a counter variable in the wrong direction from the terminal condition. Another one is accidentally resetting a counter or index variable within the loop code, instead of incrementing or decrementing it.</p>\n</section>","id":"587d7b86367417b2b2512b3d","hasEditableBoundaries":false,"instructions":"<section id=\"instructions\">\n<p>The <code>myFunc()</code> function contains an infinite loop because the terminal condition <code>i != 4</code> will never evaluate to <code>false</code> (and break the looping) - <code>i</code> will increment by 2 each pass, and jump right over 4 since <code>i</code> is odd to start. Fix the comparison operator in the terminal condition so the loop only runs for <code>i</code> less than or equal to 4.</p>\n</section>","notes":null,"removeComments":null,"challengeType":1,"helpCategory":"JavaScript","videoUrl":null,"superBlock":"javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures","certification":"javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures","translationPending":false,"forumTopicId":301192,"fields":{"blockName":"Debugging","slug":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/debugging/prevent-infinite-loops-with-a-valid-terminal-condition","tests":[{"text":"<p>Your code should change the comparison operator in the terminal condition (the middle part) of the <code>for</code> loop.</p>","testString":"assert(code.match(/i\\s*?<=\\s*?4;/g).length == 1);"},{"text":"<p>Your code should fix the comparison operator in the terminal condition of the loop.</p>","testString":"assert(!code.match(/i\\s*?!=\\s*?4;/g));"}]},"required":[],"usesMultifileEditor":false,"challengeFiles":[{"fileKey":"scriptjs","ext":"js","name":"script","contents":"function myFunc() {\n  for (let i = 1; i != 4; i += 2) {\n    console.log(\"Still going!\");\n  }\n}","head":"","tail":"","editableRegionBoundaries":[],"history":["script.js"]}]}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"certification":"javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures","superBlock":"javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures","block":"debugging","template":"","required":[],"nextChallengePath":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-data-structures/use-an-array-to-store-a-collection-of-data","prevChallengePath":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/debugging/use-caution-when-reinitializing-variables-inside-a-loop","id":"587d7b86367417b2b2512b3d"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":1,"challengeFiles":[{"name":"script","ext":"js","contents":"function myFunc() {\n for (let i = 1; i <= 4; i += 2) {\n   console.log(\"Still going!\");\n }\n}","head":"","tail":"","history":["script.js"],"fileKey":"scriptjs"}]}},"slug":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/debugging/prevent-infinite-loops-with-a-valid-terminal-condition"}},
