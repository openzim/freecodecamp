To write an algorithm, you must first understand a problem, and then solve it with coding.</p>\n<p>To make solving problems easier, it can be helpful to break them down into many chunks. Then, each chunk can be solved one by one. For example, if you are building a calculator, don't try to solve the problem as a whole. First, consider how to get inputs. Then, determine each arithmetic operation one by one. Finally, display the results.</p>\n<p>In this section we will learn to solve basic algorithm problems using JavaScript. This will help you improve your problem solving skills and prepare you to later solve more complex problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Hint</strong>: If you get stuck, try using <code>console.log()</code> to log variable values to the console. This will help to debug problems.</p>"},"allChallengeNode":{"edges":[{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/convert-celsius-to-fahrenheit"},"title":"Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/reverse-a-string"},"title":"Reverse a String"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/factorialize-a-number"},"title":"Factorialize a Number"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/find-the-longest-word-in-a-string"},"title":"Find the Longest Word in a String"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/return-largest-numbers-in-arrays"},"title":"Return Largest Numbers in Arrays"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/confirm-the-ending"},"title":"Confirm the Ending"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/repeat-a-string-repeat-a-string"},"title":"Repeat a String Repeat a String"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/truncate-a-string"},"title":"Truncate a String"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/finders-keepers"},"title":"Finders Keepers"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/boo-who"},"title":"Boo who"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/title-case-a-sentence"},"title":"Title Case a Sentence"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/slice-and-splice"},"title":"Slice and Splice"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/falsy-bouncer"},"title":"Falsy Bouncer"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/where-do-i-belong"},"title":"Where do I Belong"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/mutations"},"title":"Mutations"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/chunky-monkey"},"title":"Chunky Monkey"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"block":"basic-algorithm-scripting","slug":"/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/"}},
