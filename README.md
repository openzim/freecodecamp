# freeCodeCamp scraper

This scraper downloads selected [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) courses and puts it in a
[ZIM](https://openzim.org) file, a clean and user friendly format for storing content for offline usage.

## Architecture
This project consists of two major components:

- `zimui` - A Vue.JS application specially crafted to:
    - be embeded inside the ZIM and serve as main entry point (through compilation for offline usage with Vite)
    - present FCC curriculum, including solving exercices
    - be compatible with most ZIM readers
- `scraper` - The Python tool that build FCC ZIM. It is responsible to:
    - fetch FCC curriculum and package it into a proper format
    - embed client can read, as well as our zim builder

## Dependencies

Aside Node.JS and Python dependencies which are managed, other binary dependencies comes from Python [zimscraperlib](https://github.com/openzim/python-scraperlib/)


## Development

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Prerequisites

- Node 20.x
- Python 3.11

### Running scraper locally

You have to:
- build the `zimui` frontend which will be embededed inside the ZIM (and redo it every time you make modifications to the `zimui`)
- run the `scraper` to retrieve FCC curriculum and build the ZIM

Sample commands:
```
cd zimui
yarn install
yarn build
cd ../scraper
hatch run fcc2zim --language eng --course "regular-expressions,basic-javascript,basic-data-structures,debugging,functional-programming,object-oriented-programming,basic-algorithm-scripting,intermediate-algorithm-scripting,javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects" --name "fcc_en_javascript" --title "freeCodeCamp Javascript" --description "FCC Javascript Courses"
```

### Running scraper with Docker

Run from official version (published on GHCR.io) ; ZIM will be available in the `output` sub-folder of current working directory.

```
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd)/output:/output ghcr.io/openzim/freecodecamp:latest fcc2zim --language eng --course "regular-expressions,basic-javascript,basic-data-structures,debugging,functional-programming,object-oriented-programming,basic-algorithm-scripting,intermediate-algorithm-scripting,javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects" --name "fcc_en_javascript" --title "freeCodeCamp Javascript" --description "FCC Javascript Courses"
```

## Course Options and Limitations

Currently this scraper only supports challenge types 1, 4 and 5 (challenge types can be found in the markdown file describing the challenge). This means courses from `javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures`, `project-euler`, `rosetta-code` and most of `coding-interview-prep` curriculum (frontend projects are type 3 and are not working).

A list of courses is passed to the scraper as a comma seperated list of 'course slugs'.

When you pass a course with an unsupported challenge to the scraper, the ZIM will still create but an error message will be displayed instead of the challenge with wrong type.

You can find a list of course slugs in the [freeCodeCamp curriculum folder](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/tree/main/curriculum/challenges/english)

In docker example above, see the `--course` argument : `regular-expressions,basic-javascript,basic-data-structures,debugging,functional-programming,object-oriented-programming,basic-algorithm-scripting,intermediate-algorithm-scripting,javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects`
